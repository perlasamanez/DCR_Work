# Diameter Constrained Reliabity - Research Project

Summer 2017 Networks Reliability Research Project
- In this source code, you can find the work I contributed in for the Research Project this past Summer 2017.
- The purpose of this project is to find the starting diameter in which the reliability was bigger in a certain network. 
- Written in C++
- It goes from 0 < p < 1, as p (probabilities). It increases by 0.001.
- It finds the starting diameter constrained in which the realibility has increased with Kelman's Transformation compared to the Classical Reliability case.
